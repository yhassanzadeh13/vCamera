# vCamera
Voice Controlled Camera (vCamera) is a course project Android Application that was developed by me while I was taking the Intelligent User Interface course. 

By interacting with the user over the voice, vCamera can offer the following services: 
- The user can adjust the common features of an embedded camera using voice. The set of features is effect, flashlight, focus mode, scene mode and white balance mode. (Novel Feature)
- The user can take a photo or captures a video by saying a predefined sentence: OK camera, take a photo, or OK camera take a video
-The user can switch between the front and back camera by saying a predefined sentence: OK camera, switch! (Novel Feature)
-The user can zoom in/out before taking a photo by saying a predefined sentence like OK camera zoom in/ out. (Novel Feature)
-The user can take multiple photos by a voice command. For example: "OK Camera, take three photos". (Novel Feature)
